# Week 8 Coding One Fall 2021


###"Week 8 HW 1 - Fork of 2D Noise by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/48c17534-659e-9cb0-7bc2-12df740ae191


###"Week 8 HW 2 - Fork of True 2D Noise by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/ce9f86b9-608f-e8ce-ad35-bcb6a41bdcae

###"Week 8 HW 3 - Lighting using normals by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/06fb5941-40d8-76a0-5e1f-f0ab12fc527b

###"Week8 HW 3.b - Fork of Rotating Lighting Using Vertex Normals by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/cc01d4e0-bb46-b447-6024-1cc3abe48c6c
*This is nothing much, I experimented around with the code but I was not sure what the goal should have been*

###"Week 8 HW 4 - Squash and Stretch Full Rotate Fork of More Lighting Using Vertex Normals by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/17d9a6be-1547-b93c-e07e-b21e631a8a67


###"Week 8 HW 5 - Fork of Using Noise to change the elevation of a surface with lighting by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/6a82af23-7b71-eb82-d946-bcca78a45878


###"Week 8 HW 5 B - Fork of Using Noise to change the elevation of a surface with lighting by orsolya" on Mimic
https://mimicproject.com/code/82a91967-f5e4-d065-18c8-93493dcb06c4
*The result here is basically the same as the one before, it is just my attempt at adding in another geometry (from Week 8 HW3b) into the same image. I have not yet figured it out,though*
